# pluto-e-mail
With pluto-e-mail ( PEM );   
Pluto Notebooks, Markdown, and Julia language  
are available to a wide community with limited recources.    
Our mission is giving tips and tricks to allow learners  
and casual users to feel a home in a Pluto Notebook.  
Work anywhere with nothing to set up.  Use only an  
inexpensive device, internet, e-mail and an up-to-date  
Chrome or Firefox browser.  Julia is Fantastic, Pluto  
is Super and PEM makes the experience even Better!
